for input ,  add todo and delete all

sent the function from parent to the child using props. 

so that i can get the values that is filled inside the input tag

added click event handler on add todo button 

click handler on delete all todo button also 


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


now sent the props on task component 

task array sent

update todo function sent 

delete todo function sent 

made a final component and transfered all the props to render the data

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


added useState hooks in finalComponent 

to manage edit button and save button 

conditional rendering was done according according to the value of state variable

one more state for finding out taks is completed or not

if yes then made the state value true and added some styles according to that only

but problem arised that if marked completed and then click the delete button then the new task also gets the same css.

new task means after deleting let say task at index 4 then task at index 5 should come up and index should become 4 

in that case it also get marked as completed 


to solve it 

i just added in delete button event that if anyone clicks delete button 
make the completed status as false



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

to prevent data from deleting

for this we needed to store the data into the local storage,  that is provided in the browser

setItems( " key" , "data") --> will add the data to the storage

--->>>>  make sure that everything , whether it is key or the the data that we are sending to store 

--->>>>  to convert the data into string use JSON.stringify() function .

why not toString() ?

because it will convert data into string.  let's say if we are push an array then it will convert an array into string.

where as JSON.stringify() will only convert the data into into string without altering it's type 



TO retrieve the data from local storage ?

JSON.parse()   ->>> will convert the string data into it's original form 



it is necessary to put the checks before we do JSON.parse() , because if the data is null then doing JSON.parse() will result into errors

a simple if else check will do the work


if(validData) return validData

else return [];       --> this case will hit when nothing will be present in the local data.

when we have deleated every task of todo 

uske badd we refresh the browser then it will check if data is pressent or not?

agar present rhega toh koi dikkat nhi hai lekin iss case me toh data present rhega hie nhi iska matlab hai null

toh else case hit hoga aur ek empty array return hoga 

jo ki state variable me add ho jyega
