for input ,  add todo and delete all

sent the function from parent to the child using props. 

so that i can get the values that is filled inside the input tag

added click event handler on add todo button 

click handler on delete all todo button also 


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


now sent the props on task component 

task array sent

update todo function sent 

delete todo function sent 

made a final component and transfered all the props to render the data

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


added useState hooks in finalComponent 

to manage edit button and save button 

conditional rendering was done according according to the value of state variable

one more state for finding out taks is completed or not

if yes then made the state value true and added some styles according to that only

but problem arised that if marked completed and then click the delete button then the new task also gets the same css.

new task means after deleting let say task at index 4 then task at index 5 should come up and index should become 4 

in that case it also get marked as completed 


to solve it 

i just added in delete button event that if anyone clicks delete button 
make the completed status as false
