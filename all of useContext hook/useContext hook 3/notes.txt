suppose i want to pass the data to child3 from somewhere

parent
  child1
    child2
      child3

in normal way we will have to pass the data as a prop from parent to all the way down till child 3


<parent anyName = {} />

    <child1 Anyname = {} />

        <child2 anyname = {} />

            <child3 anyName = {} />


this is called prop drilling. in small apps its ok but in complex app it will be very complex to manage the datas.

so for passing the data from parent to child we use useContext hook


to do it just create a context by using 

    React.createContext;
