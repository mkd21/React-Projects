if we want to use setInterval or setTimeout then we must use them inside the useEffect hooks

it will make sure that closure and re render works in proper manner

if we use them directly the they take the initial value of state variable and keeps using the initial value everytime

for reference 

cleanup method is necessary because if we dont give the cleanup ten the value will be incremented twice.

because of Strict mode the setInterval is executed twice.

cleanup method makes sure the the inteval is cleared when re rendering takes place.
